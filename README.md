Circular-Recorder
=================

Windows Phone application for recording moments in a efficient way. 

Put Circular Recorder on recording mode and start your day. If anything happens worth recording during this time BOOM, hit the stop recoding button and save it. Instead of whole recording, most of which would be useless, you will only get last X minutes of recording where X is in your control. 

Unlike other recorders, Circular Recorder is a smart recorder which lets you record a moment that can happen at any instant in an efficient and elegant manner. It holds the recording in a circular buffer whose length is in your control. It records the audio just like a normal recorder but once the recording buffer is full, it starts overwriting itself from the start. In this way you always get the last X minutes of recording where X is amount of time you specify at start of recording. At the end you only get recording of the moment that matters most without the recording of time which you spent waiting for that moment to happen. 

For example if buffer length is set to 120 seconds and your recording session lasted 140, Circular Recorder will only save last 120 seconds of recording. 

Using Circular Recorder you can
    • Record audio (maximum 1 hour)
    • Record while screen is locked
    • Pause and Resume recording
    • Play recorded sound
